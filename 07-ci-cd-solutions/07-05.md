# Day Seven - Create a Pipeline

---

In this section we will ..

---

We won't do a full CI/CD setup as that is too much for this course  But we will implement some of the important aspects.


Fork the repo and modify the Jenkinsfile?

`pipelines/Jenkinsfile.first-app`

Now we need to create a _Pipeline_ job in _Jenkins_.

Click on the _New Item_ link in the left hand navigation pane.

Enter `kube7days` in the _Enter an item name_ field.  Click on the _Pipeline_ link.  Then click on the _OK_ button.

When we run the pipeline a new _Pod_ will be created with the contaienrs we defined in the `Jenkinsfile`.  As below.

```console
kubectl describe pod jenkins-slave-1mhfr-hhzm1
