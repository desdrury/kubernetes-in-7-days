What we have done in this section is ...


## Scratch

Types of job
we are using a pipeline job which expects a Jenkinsfile to describe Pipeline as Code.  Rather than configure a job manually using the Web UI.

Jenkinsfile
declarative (Visual Pipeline Editor can support) or scripted
[Declarative Pipeline Syntax 1.0 is now available](https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/)
Unfortunately the Kubernetes Jenkins Plugin does not work well for declarative pipelines when needing to define a dynamic build agent using `podTemplate`.  Therefore we must use scripted.

Overview doc on Pipeline
[Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)

[Blue Ocean](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/blueocean/)

Jenkins has many, many plugins.  You can search for them here.
[Jenkins Plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io)
Or inside Jenkins in the “Manage Jenkins” section.

We will be using the Kubernetes Plugin
https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes
Good documentation on how to use the plugin is available at the GitHub repo for it.
[GitHub - jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin: Jenkins plugin to run dynamic slaves in a Kubernetes/Docker environment](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin)
This include a number of examples of how to use the plugin in Pipeline.
[kubernetes-plugin/examples at master · jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin · GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/tree/master/examples)
You can get the ID for a plugin from the plugin page, i.e.
https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes

We also have the following plugins installed.
