# Day Seven - Jenkins

---

In this section we are going to install [_Jenkins_](https://jenkins.io) into our cluster.  _Jenkins_ is a very popular open source jobs and automation server that is often used for CI/CD.

---


## Install

To install _Jenkins_ we will use a [_Helm Chart_](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/jenkins) from the `stable` repository.  We will also make use of a `values.yaml` file to override the default values when deploying the _Chart_.

```console
helm upgrade --install jenkins \
  --namespace jenkins \
  -f charts-values/jenkins/values.yaml \
  --version 0.16.18 \
  stable/jenkins
```

The values.yaml file that will be used to customise the installation of _Jenkins_ is shown below.

```yaml
---
rbac:
  install: true

Master:
  Image:    jenkins/jenkins
  ImageTag: 2.136
  ServiceType: ClusterIP
  HostName:    jenkins.192.168.26.11.nip.io

  Ingress:
    Annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx

Persistence:
  Enabled: true
  StorageClass: rook-ceph-block
  Size: 2Gi
```


## Configure

Now we can login to _Jenkins_.  But first we will need to get the password for the `admin` user.  The following command shows how.

```console
printf $(kubectl get secret --namespace jenkins jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo
```

Now we can access the _Jenkins_ web UI.

[http://jenkins.192.168.26.11.nip.io/login](http://jenkins.192.168.26.11.nip.io/login)

On the login form use the username `admin` and the password that you got from the `kubectl` command.

We will now need to create a _Jenkins Credential_ for our _Docker Hub_ account so that later on when we build the `first-app` using a `Jenkinsfile` we are able to push it.  We don't have to create a _Credential_ for our _GitHub_ user as we will be working with a public fork of the Packt repo for [_Kubernetes in 7 Days_](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/kubernetes-in-7-days-video).

Click on the _Credentials_ link in the left hand navigation pane.

Now, hover over the _(global)_ link and a small arrow will appear to the right.  Make sure you click with the pointer over the arrow, and an _Add credentials_ link will appear.  Click it.

On the following page add your _Docker Hub_ username and password to the _Username_ and _Password_ fields.  Also, add `docker-hub-user` to the _ID_ field.  Then click on the _OK_ button.

You wlll need a Docker Hub account to be able to push the image to.  Local Registry is not in scope for this course.


## Docker in Docker



We will also need a _Docker in Docker_ (dind) to build our containers.

```console
helm upgrade --install dind \
  --namespace jenkins \
  charts/dind/
```



What we have done in this section is ...


## Scratch

Types of job
we are using a pipeline job which expects a Jenkinsfile to describe Pipeline as Code.  Rather than configure a job manually using the Web UI.

Jenkinsfile
declarative (Visual Pipeline Editor can support) or scripted
[Declarative Pipeline Syntax 1.0 is now available](https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/)
Unfortunately the Kubernetes Jenkins Plugin does not work well for declarative pipelines when needing to define a dynamic build agent using `podTemplate`.  Therefore we must use scripted.

Overview doc on Pipeline
[Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)

[Blue Ocean](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/blueocean/)

Jenkins has many, many plugins.  You can search for them here.
[Jenkins Plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io)
Or inside Jenkins in the “Manage Jenkins” section.

Lots of pipeline examples
https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-examples

We will be using the Kubernetes Plugin
https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes
Good documentation on how to use the plugin is available at the GitHub repo for it.
[GitHub - jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin: Jenkins plugin to run dynamic slaves in a Kubernetes/Docker environment](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin)
This include a number of examples of how to use the plugin in Pipeline.
[kubernetes-plugin/examples at master · jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin · GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/tree/master/examples)
You can get the ID for a plugin from the plugin page, i.e.
https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes

We also have the following plugins installed.
