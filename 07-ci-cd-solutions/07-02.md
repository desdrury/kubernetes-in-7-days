Continuous Integration is a practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository severl times a day.  With every every check-in resulting in an automated build.

* Creates a constant check on the code health
* Code quality (Sonarqube)
* Code coverage (Sonarqube)
* Automated Testing
* Vulnerability scans (Clair)

Workflow

* Developer develops code
* Checks code into code repository (commit)
* Automated pipeline starts (triggered by a webhook in source code repsoitory)
  * Check out source
  * Build
    * Including retrieving dependancies
  * Test
    * Unit
    * Functional
    * Security
    * Coverage
    * Vulnerability
    * Integration
  * Package
  * Scan
  * Publish to artefact repository (Docker Registry, Artifactory, etc)

**Continuous Delivery** is the capability to do automated deployments. 
Involves the steps required to deploy to non-production environments.  And then possibly integration testing. 

**Continuous Deployment**  Put simply, continuous deployment is continuous delivery that extends to automatically pushing the deployment to production once some predetermined criteria is met.  You might not want to go this far and still trigger manually.  However, the deployment scripts used should be those that have been used in the **Continuous Delivery** phase.
