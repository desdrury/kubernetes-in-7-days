# Wrap Up

---

Well it’s been quite a journey that we’ve been on.  Hopefully you’ve learned  a lot of things along the way and you now have the confidence to put Kubernetes to use in the real world.  Of course what was covered in this course was really just scratching the surface and hopefully you are feeling inspired to go on and learn much more.  Thankyou for taking the the time to listen to me and I wish you all the best in your future explorations.
